Check your 'making first contribution' knowledge:

- You have a GitHub account i.e github.com
- You have configured your git with the username and email as in GitHub i.e 'git config' or edit '~/.gitconfig'
	-  Bonus: Learn other 'git config' options. Helpful in storing credentials.

# https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
- You will need a Personal Auth Token (PAT) to have write/read access to your repositories i.e it's your password
- Identify a project to contribute to i.e https://github.com/KamiLimu1/projects-cohort7
- Make a fork of the identified project i.e creates a copy of the project in your account
- Clone the forked project to you working directory i.e 'git clone <project-url>'
- Create a new branch and make changes to the README.md file in that branch
- Add the file and commit i.e use 'Added contributor: <your-name>' as commit message
- Before pushing, make sure there has been no new change in the main branch:
	- Checkout to the main branch
	- Git pull to check if there are any changes i.e 'git pull <project-url>' & note if there are new changes
	- Checkout back to the feature branch
	- If there were changes, rebase your branch to get them i.e 'git rebase main'
- Now, you can push the changes. i.e 'git push -u origin HEAD' With the steps above, hopefully, you do not have any conflict.
- Your changes are now in the forked repository. But, they ought to be added to the main project we are contributing to.
- [So], in your fork, hit the contribute button to make a pull request (PR)
- Once your PR is merged, everyone can see you changes. If they pull, the changes should be seen locally.
- Yay, you are a contributor!

Note:
- There are concepts, like rebasing and reseting that have not been covered. We have to experience some errors to properly learn what & when they are used.
- If you do not remember how to perform an action, i.e creating a branch and checking out, google 'creating a branch and checking out'
